When generating transactions in a wallet or service, the following steps can be used:

1. User Input:
  The user inputs an easy-to-remember User ID instead of the SymID for the account to which they want to send the transaction.
  
2. Retrieve SymID:
   The wallet or service uses the citizen_getSymIDByUserID API to retrieve the SymID that is matched 1:1 with the provided User ID.

3.Create Transaction:
  Use the retrieved SymID to create the transaction message.  
  
4. Transaction Submission:
  Submit the transaction message. The process remains identical to the existing transaction structure, with the only addition being the step to retrieve the SymID.
  
By following this process, users can conveniently utilize User IDs while maintaining compatibility with the existing transaction system.
