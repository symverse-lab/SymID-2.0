# SymID-2.0
3-20 letter starting with alphabet can be used as ID instead of existing SymID
Purpose of Use
Symverse blockchain is a permissioned blockchain based on a SymID, which consists of a 10-byte hexadecimal string. Therefore, all users who wish to use the Symverse blockchain must be issued a SymID. SymID is essential for issuing transactions and setting oracle parameters. However, its composition as a 10-byte hexadecimal string makes it difficult for users to remember, hindering its function as an ID. To address this issue, we support the creation of a UserID that matches SymID on a 1:1 basis, consisting of characters or numbers, to allow users to use it conveniently.
